# Dubo-SQL

## Introduction
This repository pairs with the paper "Dubo-SQL: Diverse Retrieval-Augmented Generation and Fine Tuning for Text-to-SQL". In that paper, we outline our methods for low-cost fine tuning and novel retrieval-augmented generation for text-to-SQL. Dubo-SQL v1 fine tunes GPT-3.5 to achieve state-of-the-art performance on the [BIRD-SQL](https://bird-bench.github.io/) benchmark as of the date of its submission. Dubo-SQL v2 uses GPT-4 Turbo with a novel approach to retrieval-augmented generation to achieve higher performance on the BIRD-SQL dev set. See the results from tables 1 and 2 of the paper.
